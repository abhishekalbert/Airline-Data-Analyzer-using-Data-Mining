<b>Problem Statement</b>
Simplified version: <i>"Given a destination and a date range, which is a better airport to fly out from - SFO or OAK?"</i>
We wanted to apply machine learning techniques to build a predictive model which can help flyer decide which airport to choose. Our model was built using data for all US domestic flights from 2001-08. Our models works for all airports, however we were particularly interested in SFO/OAK. There is a popular urban myth to fly from OAK to avoid delays. But we find that myth is not true always.
